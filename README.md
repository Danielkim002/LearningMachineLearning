# LearningMachineLearning
This repository is a collection of my machine learning endeavors. It will contain experiments, small and large projects, and different online courses that will show my growth overtime.

# H1 I. Free Code Camp

## H2  1.Titanic Example:
  
### H3    This is a simple jupyter file that contains basic tensorflow implementations of linear estimates
    
## H2  2.Flower Classification Example:
  
 ### H3   This is a jupyter file that contains a basic tensorflow implementation of a Dense NN classifier that can classify flowers based on the flowers measurements
    
## H2  3.Hidden Markov Example:
  
 ### H3   This jupyter file showcases an example of how to implements a hidden markov scenario in Tensorflow
    
## H2  4.Neural Networks
  
  ### H3  A.Clothing Example
    
#### H4      This Jupyter file showcases a tensorflow keras implementation of a dense neural network that can classify items of clothing
      
  ### H3  B.CNN Example:
    
#### H4      This jupyter file showcases CNN implementations in tensorflow, as well as certain data augmentation techniques. 
      
 ### H3   C.RNN Example:
    
#### H4      This jupyter file showcases Reccurent NN implementations in tensorflow.
      
 ### H3   D.RNN Play Generator:
    
 #### H4     This jupyter file showcases a Play generator that can generate plays using a RNN made with TensorFlow
      
## H2  5.Machine Learning Projects:
  
 ### H3   A.RPS
    
   #### H4   This python repository is a challenge given by FCC to create a NN that can beat different algorithms in Rock Paper Scissors with a win rate of at least 60%
