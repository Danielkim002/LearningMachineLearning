# LearningMachineLearning
This repository is a collection of my machine learning endeavors. It will contain experiments, small and large projects, and different online courses that will show my growth overtime.

I. Free Code Camp
  1.Titanic Example:
    This is a simple jupyter file that contains basic tensorflow implementations of linear estimates
  2.Flower Classification Example:
    This is a jupyter file that contains a basic tensorflow implementation of a Dense NN classifier that can classify flowers based on the flowers measurements
  3.Hidden Markov Example:
    This jupyter file showcases an example of how to implements a hidden markov scenario in Tensorflow
  4.Neural Networks
    A.Clothing Example
      This Jupyter file showcases a tensorflow keras implementation of a dense neural network that can classify items of clothing
    B.CNN Example:
      This jupyter file showcases CNN implementations in tensorflow, as well as certain data augmentation techniques. 
    C.RNN Example:
      This jupyter file showcases Reccurent NN implementations in tensorflow.
    D.RNN Play Generator:
      This jupyter file showcases a Play generator that can generate plays using a RNN made with TensorFlow
  5.Machine Learning Projects:
    A.RPS
      This python repository is a challenge given by FCC to create a NN that can beat different algorithms in Rock Paper Scissors with a win rate of at least 60%
